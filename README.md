Short Description: 
As a user i would like to have a Retrieval based Chatbots, which gives me suggestions to chat and retrieve 
pre-saved answers. It'll be like choice based chats. Every choice might end the story in very different ending.
Since i always wanted to be a writer and after reading "Goosebumps: Choose your scare" got a brilliant story 
idea. So wanna develop a chat based game. Might make it a mobile app later but for now its just a python gui. 

Steps to create Chatbot:
1. Import and load the data file
2. Preprocess data
3. Create training and testing data
4. Build the model
5. Predict the response

Technological Requisites:
1. nltk :- To tokenize words in sentence for learning
2. Keras :- To build deep neural network for training the dataset
3. Tkinter :- To make python gui

Dataset:
No idea yet, might create might download from kaggle. Surprising element of the project.
